## Install R if needed

The [R project for statistical computing][r-lang] provides the R programming enviornment, which you can download and install at the link. The R language is supported by an library of software, the [Comprehensive R Archive Network][cran], or CRAN, from which you can download both R and R language packages.

**R should already be installed on your computer in the laboratory. To confirm, please type `R`<kbd>enter</kbd> at the bash command prompt.**

> ## Ubuntu Linux using `apt`
> 
> You can install R from the Ubuntu Linux command line using the `apt` package manager. This should
> be equivalent to downloading from CRAN, except that the Ubuntu package manager may be slightly
> behind the most recent R version release. To install using apt, type
> 
>  ~~~
>  sudo apt-get install r-base-core
>  ~~~
> {: .language-bash}
>
> You need to use `sudo` for this command because installing software using apt requires administrator privileges. You will be prompted for an administrator (privileged) password.

**R should already be installed on your computer in the laboratory. To confirm, please try running RStudio from the Ubuntu launcher**
